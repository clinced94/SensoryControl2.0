SensoryControlV2

This is SensoryControl, an Android application to assist people with self-regulating their mood and evergy levels.

To run the application you will need to load the SensoryControlV2 project into Android Studio.

The recommender system is not connected to the rest of the application, so the python file containing the recommender system has been hardcoded with some values as an example of how it works. To run this you just need to run the python file, and make sure that the text file of activities is accessed correctly.
